Notes from https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/building-an-angular-5-project-with-bootstrap-4-and-firebase-4504ff7717c1

In Firebase documentation for web application, there is some
JavaScript for "Add Firebase to your web app". But for Angular,
you need just this in `environments/environments.ts`:

```
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  firebase: {
    apiKey: "[...]",
    authDomain: "[...]",
    databaseURL: "[...]",
    projectId: "[...]",
    storageBucket: "[...]",
    messagingSenderId: "[...]"
  }
};
```

And in `environments/environments.prod.ts`, same but with
```
  production: true,
```
